Check result of `send` call.

<!--more-->

## Bad Practice
1. result of "send" call ignored
```solidity
x.send(55);
```

## Recommended
1. result of "send" call checked with if statement
```solidity
if(x.send(55)) {}
```

2. result of "send" call checked within a require
```solidity
require(payable(walletAddress).send(moneyAmount), "Failed to send moneyAmount");
```
