Non-external functions and state variables should start with a single underscore. Others, shouldn't

## Bad Practice
1. Internal function with incorrect naming
```solidity
function thisIsInternal() internal {}
```

2. Private function with incorrect naming
```solidity
function thisIsPrivate() private {}
```

3. Internal state variable with incorrect naming
```solidity
uint256 internal thisIsInternalVariable;
```

4. Internal state variable with incorrect naming (no visibility is considered internal)
```solidity
uint256 thisIsInternalVariable;
```

## Recommended
1. Internal function with correct naming
```solidity
function _thisIsInternal() internal {}
```

2. Private function with correct naming
```solidity
function _thisIsPrivate() private {}
```

3. Internal state variable with correct naming
```solidity
uint256 internal _thisIsInternalVariable;
```

4. Internal state variable with correct naming (no visibility is considered internal)
```solidity
uint256 _thisIsInternalVariable;
```
