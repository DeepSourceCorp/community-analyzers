Forbid or enforce explicit types (like uint256) that have an alias (like uint).

<!--more-->

## Bad Practice
1. If explicit is selected
```solidity
uint public variableName
```

2. If implicit is selected
```solidity
uint256 public variableName
```

3. At any setting
```solidity
uint public variableName = uint256(5)
```

## Recommended
1. If explicit is selected
```solidity
uint256 public variableName
```

2. If implicit is selected
```solidity
uint public variableName
```

3. If explicit is selected
```solidity
uint256 public variableName = uint256(5)
```
