Solidity v0.8.18 introduced named parameters on the mappings definition.

## Bad Practice
1. No naming at all in regular mapping 
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256)) public tokenBalances;
```

2. Missing any variable name in regular mapping uint256
```solidity
mapping(address token => uint256)) public tokenBalances;
```

3. Missing any variable name in regular mapping address
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256 balance)) public tokenBalances;
```

4. No MAIN KEY naming in nested mapping. Other naming are not enforced
```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address token => uint256 balance)) public tokenBalances;
```

## Recommended
1. To enter "users" mapping the key called "name" is needed to get the "balance"
```solidity
mapping(string name => uint256 balance) public users;
```

2. To enter owner token balance, the main key "owner" enters another mapping which its key is "token" to get its "balance"
```solidity
mapping(address owner => mapping(address token => uint256 balance)) public tokenBalances;
```

3. Main key of mapping is enforced. On nested mappings other naming are not neccesary
```solidity
mapping(address owner => mapping(address => uint256)) public tokenBalances;
```

4. Main key of the parent mapping is enforced. No naming in nested mapping uint256
```solidity
mapping(address owner => mapping(address token => uint256)) public tokenBalances;
```

5. Main key of the parent mapping is enforced. No naming in nested mapping address
```solidity
mapping(address owner => mapping(address => uint256 balance)) public tokenBalances;
```
