## Not Recommended(s)
1. No naming at all in regular mapping 
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256)) public tokenBalances;
```

2. Missing any variable name in regular mapping uint256
```solidity
mapping(address token => uint256)) public tokenBalances;
```

3. Missing any variable name in regular mapping address
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256 balance)) public tokenBalances;
```

4. No MAIN KEY naming in nested mapping. Other naming are not enforced
```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address token => uint256 balance)) public tokenBalances;
```
