Import statement includes an entire file instead of selected symbols.

<!--more-->

## Bad Practice
1. import all members from a file
```solidity
import * from "foo.sol"
```

2. import an entire file
```solidity
import "foo.sol"
```

## Recommended
1. import names explicitly
```solidity
import {A} from "./A.sol"
```

2. import entire file into a name
```solidity
import "./A.sol" as A
```

3. import entire file into a name
```solidity
import * as A from "./A.sol"
```
