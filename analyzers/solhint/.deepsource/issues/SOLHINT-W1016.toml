Check that all public or external functions are override. This is iseful to make sure that the whole API is extracted in an interface.

<!--more-->

## Bad Practice
1. A public function is not an override
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

contract Foo {
  function foo() public {}
}

```

## Recommended
1. All public functions are overrides
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

contract Foo is FooInterface {
  function foo() public override {}
}

```
