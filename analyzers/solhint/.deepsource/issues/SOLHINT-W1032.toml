## Bad Practice
1. Constructor is placed after other functions
```solidity

      pragma solidity 0.4.4;


      contract A {

                function () public payable {}
                constructor() public {}

      }

```

## Recommended
1. Constructor is placed before other functions
```solidity

      pragma solidity 0.4.4;


      contract A {

                constructor() public {}
                function () public payable {}

      }

```
