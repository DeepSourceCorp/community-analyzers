## Bad Practice
1. Require without reason string
```solidity

      pragma solidity 0.4.4;


      contract A {

        function b() public {
          require(!has(role, account));
          role.bearer[account] = true;
          role.bearer[account] = true;
        }

      }

```

## Recommended
1. Require with reason string
```solidity

      pragma solidity 0.4.4;


      contract A {

        function b() public {
          require(!has(role, account), "Roles: account already has role");
          role.bearer[account] = true;
          role.bearer[account] = true;
        }

      }

```
