Contract has `some count` states declarations but allowed no more than maxstates.

## Bad Practice
1. High number of states
```solidity

      pragma solidity 0.4.4;


      contract A {
                uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
      }

```

## Recommended
1. Low number of states
```solidity

      pragma solidity 0.4.4;


      contract A {
                uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private a;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
        uint private constant TEST = 1;
      }

```
