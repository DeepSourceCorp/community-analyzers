description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a member declared inside an
extension uses the `super` keyword . Extensions aren't classes and don't
have superclasses, so the `super` keyword serves no purpose.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `super` can't be used
in an extension:

```dart
extension E on Object {
  String get displayString => [!super!].toString();
}
```

#### Common fixes

Remove the `super` keyword :

```dart
extension E on Object {
  String get displayString => toString();
}
```
