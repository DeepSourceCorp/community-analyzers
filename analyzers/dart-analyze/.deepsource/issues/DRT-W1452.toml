description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when it finds a function invocation,
but the name of the function being invoked is defined to be something other
than a function.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `Binary` is the name of
a function type, not a function:

```dart
typedef Binary = int Function(int, int);

int f() {
  return Binary(1, 2);
}
```

#### Common fixes

Replace the name with the name of a function.
