description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a value in a constant map
literal isn't a constant value.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `a` isn't a constant:

```dart
var a = 'a';
var m = const {0: a};
```

#### Common fixes

If the map needs to be a constant map, then make the key a constant:

```dart
const a = 'a';
var m = const {0: a};
```

If the map doesn't need to be a constant map, then remove the `const`
keyword:

```dart
var a = 'a';
var m = {0: a};
```
