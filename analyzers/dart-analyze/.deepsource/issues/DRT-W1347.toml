description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an instance field declaration is
found in an extension. It isn't valid to define an instance field because
extensions can only add behavior, not state.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `s` is an instance
field:

```dart
extension E on String {
  String s;
}
```

#### Common fixes

Remove the field, make it a static field, or convert it to be a getter,
setter, or method.
