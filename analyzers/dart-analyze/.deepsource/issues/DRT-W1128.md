From [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/style#do-name-types-using-uppercamelcase):

**DO** name types using UpperCamelCase.

Classes and typedefs should capitalize the first letter of each word (including
the first word), and use no separators.

**GOOD:**
```dart
class SliderMenu {
  // ...
}

class HttpRequest {
  // ...
}

typedef num Adder(num x, num y);
```
