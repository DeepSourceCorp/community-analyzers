description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a class, mixin, or extension
declaration declares a type parameter with the same name as the class,
mixin, or extension that declares it.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the type parameter `C`
has the same name as the class `C` of which it's a part:

```dart
class C<C> {}
```

#### Common fixes

Rename either the type parameter, or the class, mixin, or extension:

```dart
class C<T> {}
```
