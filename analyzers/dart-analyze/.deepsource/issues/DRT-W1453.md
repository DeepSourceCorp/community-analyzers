The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a function invocation is found,
but the name being referenced isn't the name of a function, or when the
expression computing the function doesn't compute a function.

#### Examples

The following code produces this diagnostic because `x` isn't a function:

```dart
int x = 0;

int f() => x;

var y = [!x!]();
```

The following code produces this diagnostic because `f()` doesn't return a
function:

```dart
int x = 0;

int f() => x;

var y = [!f()!]();
```

#### Common fixes

If you need to invoke a function, then replace the code before the argument
list with the name of a function or with an expression that computes a
function:

```dart
int x = 0;

int f() => x;

var y = f();
```
