description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an import isn't needed because
none of the names that are imported are referenced within the importing
library.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because nothing defined in
`dart:async` is referenced in the library:

```dart
import [!'dart:async'!];

void main() {}
```

#### Common fixes

If the import isn't needed, then remove it.

If some of the imported names are intended to be used, then add the missing
code.
