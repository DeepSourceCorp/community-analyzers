The analyzer produces this diagnostic when `null` is passed to either the
constructor `Future.value` or the method `Completer.complete` when the type
argument used to create the instance was non-nullable. Even though the type
system can't express this restriction, passing in a `null` results in a
runtime exception.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `null` is being passed
to the constructor `Future.value` even though the type argument is the
non-nullable type `String`:

```dart
Future<String> f() {
  return Future.value([!null!]);
}
```

#### Common fixes

Pass in a non-null value:

```dart
Future<String> f() {
  return Future.value('');
}
```
