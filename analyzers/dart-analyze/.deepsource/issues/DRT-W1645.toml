description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a typedef refers to itself,
either directly or indirectly.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `F` depends on itself
indirectly through `G`:

```dart
typedef F = void Function(G);
typedef G = void Function(F);
```

#### Common fixes

Change one or more of the typedefs in the cycle so that none of them refer
to themselves:

```dart
typedef F = void Function(G);
typedef G = void Function(int);
```
