The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a class inherits two or more
conflicting signatures for a member and doesn't provide an implementation
that satisfies all the inherited signatures.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `C` is inheriting the
declaration of `m` from `A`, and that implementation isn't consistent with
the signature of `m` that's inherited from `B`:

```dart
class A {
  void m({int a}) {}
}

class B {
  void m({int b}) {}
}

class [!C!] extends A implements B {
}
```

#### Common fixes

Add an implementation of the method that satisfies all the inherited
signatures:

```dart
class A {
  void m({int a}) {}
}

class B {
  void m({int b}) {}
}

class C extends A implements B {
  void m({int a, int b}) {}
}
```
