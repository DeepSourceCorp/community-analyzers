description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a mixin declaration uses an `on`
clause to specify a superclass constraint, and the class that's specified
is followed by a `?`.

It isn't valid to specify a nullable superclass constraint because doing so
would have no meaning; it wouldn't change the interface being depended on
by the mixin containing the `on` clause.

Note, however, that it _is_ valid to use a nullable type as a type argument
to the superclass constraint, such as `mixin A on B<C?> {}`.


#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `A?` is a nullable type
and nullable types can't be used in an `on` clause:

```dart
class C {}
mixin M on [!C?!] {}
```

#### Common fixes

Remove the question mark from the type:

```dart
class C {}
mixin M on C {}
```
