title: "This function has a return type of '{0}', but doesn't end with a return statement."

---
Any function or method that doesn't end with either an explicit return or a
throw implicitly returns `null`. This is rarely the desired behavior. The
analyzer produces this diagnostic when it finds an implicit return.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `f` doesn't end with a
return:

```dart
int [!f!](int x) {
  if (x < 0) {
    return 0;
  }
}
```

#### Common fixes

Add a `return` statement that makes the return value explicit, even if
`null` is the appropriate value.
