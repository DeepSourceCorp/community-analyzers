title: "A constant redirecting constructor can't redirect to a non-constant constructor"

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a constructor marked as `const`
redirects to a constructor that isn't marked as `const`.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the constructor `C.a`
is marked as `const` but redirects to the constructor `C.b`, which isn't:

```dart
class C {
  const C.a() : this.[!b!]();
  C.b();
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the non-constant constructor can be marked as `const`, then mark it as
`const`:

```dart
class C {
  const C.a() : this.b();
  const C.b();
}
```

If the non-constant constructor can't be marked as `const`, then either
remove the redirect or remove `const` from the redirecting constructor:

```dart
class C {
  C.a() : this.b();
  C.b();
}
```
