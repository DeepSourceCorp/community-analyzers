The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the body of a function has the
`async` modifier even though the return type of the function isn't
assignable to `Future`.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the body of the
function `f` has the `async` modifier even though the return type isn't
assignable to `Future`:

```dart
[!int!] f() async {
  return 0;
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the function should be asynchronous, then change the return type to be
assignable to `Future`:

```dart
Future<int> f() async {
  return 0;
}
```

If the function should be synchronous, then remove the `async` modifier:

```dart
int f() => 0;
```
