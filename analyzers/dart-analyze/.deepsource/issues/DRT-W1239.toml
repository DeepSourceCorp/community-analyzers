The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name of a type name appears
on the left-hand side of an assignment expression.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the assignment to the
class `C` is invalid:

```dart
class C {}

void f() {
  [!C!] = null;
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the right-hand side should be assigned to something else, such as a
local variable, then change the left-hand side:

```dart
void f() {}

void g() {
  var c = null;
  print(c);
}
```
