title: "Avoid method calls or property accesses on a \"dynamic\" target"
verbose_name: "avoid_dynamic_calls"
category: "bug-risk"
weight: 70
severity: "major"

**DO** avoid method calls or accessing properties on an object that is either
explicitly or implicitly statically typed "dynamic". Dynamic calls are treated
slightly different in every runtime environment and compiler, but most
production modes (and even some development modes) have both compile size and
runtime performance penalties associated with dynamic calls.

Additionally, targets typed "dynamic" disables most static analysis, meaning it
is easier to lead to a runtime "NoSuchMethodError" or "NullError" than properly
statically typed Dart code.

There is an exception to methods and properties that exist on "Object?":
- a.hashCode
- a.runtimeType
- a.noSuchMethod(someInvocation)
- a.toString()

... these members are dynamically dispatched in the web-based runtimes, but not
in the VM-based ones. Additionally, they are so common that it would be very
punishing to disallow `any.toString()` or `any == true`, for example.

Note that despite "Function" being a type, the semantics are close to identical
to "dynamic", and calls to an object that is typed "Function" will also trigger
this lint.

**BAD:**
```dart
void explicitDynamicType(dynamic object) {
  print(object.foo());
}

void implicitDynamicType(object) {
  print(object.foo());
}

abstract class SomeWrapper {
  T doSomething<T>();
}

void inferredDynamicType(SomeWrapper wrapper) {
  var object = wrapper.doSomething();
  print(object.foo());
}

void callDynamic(dynamic function) {
  function();
}

void functionType(Function function) {
  function();
}
```

**GOOD:**
```dart
void explicitType(Fooable object) {
  object.foo();
}

void castedType(dynamic object) {
  (object as Fooable).foo();
}

abstract class SomeWrapper {
  T doSomething<T>();
}

void inferredType(SomeWrapper wrapper) {
  var object = wrapper.doSomething<Fooable>();
  object.foo();
}

void functionTypeWithParameters(Function() function) {
  function();
}
```
