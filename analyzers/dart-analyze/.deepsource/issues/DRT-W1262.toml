description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a class, mixin, or extension
declaration declares a type parameter with the same name as one of the
members of the class, mixin, or extension that declares it.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the type parameter `T`
has the same name as the field `T`:

```dart
class C<T> {
  int T = 0;
}
```

#### Common fixes

Rename either the type parameter or the member with which it conflicts:

```dart
class C<T> {
  int total = 0;
}
```
