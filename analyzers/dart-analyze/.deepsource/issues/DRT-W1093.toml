**DO** use Flutter TODO format.

From the [Flutter docs](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo#comments):

> TODOs should include the string TODO in all caps, followed by the GitHub username of the person with the best context about the problem referenced by the TODO in parenthesis. A TODO is not a commitment that the person referenced will fix the problem, it is intended to be the person with enough context to explain the problem. Thus, when you create a TODO, it is almost always your username that is given.

**GOOD:**
```dart
// TODO(username): message.
// TODO(username): message, https://URL-to-issue.
```
