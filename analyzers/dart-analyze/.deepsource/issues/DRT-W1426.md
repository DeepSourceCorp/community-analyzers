title: "Only const constructors can have the `@literal` annotation."
verbose_name: "invalid_literal_annotation"

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the [`literal`][meta-literal]
annotation is applied to anything other than a const constructor.

#### Examples

The following code produces this diagnostic because the constructor isn't
a `const` constructor:

```dart
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

class C {
  [!@literal!]
  C();
}
```

The following code produces this diagnostic because `x` isn't a
constructor:

```dart
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

[!@literal!]
var x;
```

#### Common fixes

If the annotation is on a constructor and the constructor should always be
invoked with `const`, when possible, then mark the constructor with the
`const` keyword:

```dart
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

class C {
  @literal
  const C();
}
```

If the constructor can't be marked as `const`, then remove the annotation.

If the annotation is on anything other than a constructor, then remove the
annotation:

```dart
var x;
```
