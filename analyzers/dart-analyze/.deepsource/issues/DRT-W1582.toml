description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a record type annotation with a
single positional field doesn't have a trailing comma after the field.

In some locations a record type with a single positional field could also
be a parenthesized expression. A trailing comma is required to
disambiguate these two valid interpretations.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the record type has
one positional field, but doesn't have a trailing comma:

```dart
void f((int) r) {}
```

#### Common fixes

Add a trailing comma:

```dart
void f((int,) r) {}
```
