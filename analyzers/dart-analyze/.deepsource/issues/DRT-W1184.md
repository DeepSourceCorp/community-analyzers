**AVOID** returning null from members whose return type is bool, double, int,
or num.

Functions that return primitive types such as bool, double, int, and num are
generally expected to return non-nullable values.  Thus, returning null where a
primitive type was expected can lead to runtime exceptions.

**BAD:**
```dart
bool getBool() => null;
num getNum() => null;
int getInt() => null;
double getDouble() => null;
```

**GOOD:**
```dart
bool getBool() => false;
num getNum() => -1;
int getInt() => -1;
double getDouble() => -1.0;
```
