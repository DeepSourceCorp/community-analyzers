The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a key in a map pattern isn't a
constant expression.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the key `A()` isn't a
constant:

```dart
void f(Object x) {
  if (x case {[!A()!]: 0}) {}
}

class A {
  const A();
}
```

#### Common fixes

Use a constant for the key:

```dart
void f(Object x) {
  if (x case {const A(): 0}) {}
}

class A {
  const A();
}
```
