title: "Spread elements in map literals must implement 'Map'"
verbose_name: "not_map_spread"
category: "bug-risk"
weight: 70
severity: "major"
---
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the static type of the
expression of a spread element that appears in a map literal doesn't
implement the type `Map`.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `l` isn't a `Map`:

```dart
var l =  <String>['a', 'b'];
var m = <int, String>{...[!l!]};
```

#### Common fixes

The most common fix is to replace the expression with one that produces a
map:

```dart
var l =  <String>['a', 'b'];
var m = <int, String>{...l.asMap()};
```
