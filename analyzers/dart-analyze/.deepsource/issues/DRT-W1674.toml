The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a show combinator includes a
name that isn't defined by the library being imported.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `dart:math` doesn't
define the name `String`:

```dart
import 'dart:math' show min, [!String!];

var x = min(0, 1);
```

#### Common fixes

If a different name should be shown, then correct the name. Otherwise,
remove the name from the list:

```dart
import 'dart:math' show min;

var x = min(0, 1);
```
