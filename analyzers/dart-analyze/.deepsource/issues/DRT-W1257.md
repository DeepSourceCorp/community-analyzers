title: "Concrete classes can't have 'Enum' as a superinterface"

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a concrete class indirectly has
the class `Enum` as a superinterface.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the concrete class `B`
has `Enum` as a superinterface as a result of implementing `A`:

```dart
abstract class A implements Enum {}

class [!B!] implements A {}
```

#### Common fixes

If the implemented class isn't the class you intend to implement, then
change it:

```dart
abstract class A implements Enum {}

class B implements C {}

class C {}
```

If the implemented class can be changed to not implement `Enum`, then do
so:

```dart
abstract class A {}

class B implements A {}
```

If the implemented class can't be changed to not implement `Enum`, then
remove it from the `implements` clause:

```dart
abstract class A implements Enum {}

class B {}
```
