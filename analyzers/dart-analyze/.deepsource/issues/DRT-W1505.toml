description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a condition, such as an `if` or
`while` loop, doesn't have the static type `bool`.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `x` has the static type
`int`:

```dart
void f(int x) {
  if ([!x!]) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

#### Common fixes

Change the condition so that it produces a Boolean value:

```dart
void f(int x) {
  if (x == 0) {
    // ...
  }
}
```
