title: "The instance member '{0}' can't be accessed in an initializer"
verbose_name: "implicit_this_reference_in_initializer"
category: "bug-risk"
weight: 70
severity: "major"

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when it finds a reference to an
instance member in a constructor's initializer list.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `defaultX` is an
instance member:

```dart
class C {
  int x;

  C() : x = [!defaultX!];

  int get defaultX => 0;
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the member can be made static, then do so:

```dart
class C {
  int x;

  C() : x = defaultX;

  static int get defaultX => 0;
}
```

If not, then replace the reference in the initializer with a different
expression that doesn't use an instance member:

```dart
class C {
  int x;

  C() : x = 0;

  int get defaultX => 0;
}
```
