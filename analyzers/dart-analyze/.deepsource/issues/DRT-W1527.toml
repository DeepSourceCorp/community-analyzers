verbose_name = "non_generative_constructor"
description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the initializer list of a
constructor invokes a constructor from the superclass, and the invoked
constructor is a factory constructor. Only a generative constructor can be
invoked in the initializer list.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the invocation of the
constructor `super.one()` is invoking a factory constructor:

```dart
class A {
  factory A.one() = B;
  A.two();
}

class B extends A {
  B() : super.one();
}
```

#### Common fixes

Change the super invocation to invoke a generative constructor:

```dart
class A {
  factory A.one() = B;
  A.two();
}

class B extends A {
  B() : super.two();
}
```

If the generative constructor is the unnamed constructor, and if there are
no arguments being passed to it, then you can remove the super invocation.
