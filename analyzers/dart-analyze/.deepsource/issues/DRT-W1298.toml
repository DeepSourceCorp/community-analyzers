The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a deprecated library or class
member is used in a different package.

#### Example

If the method `m` in the class `C` is annotated with `@deprecated`, then
the following code produces this diagnostic:

```dart
void f(C c) {
  c.m();
}
```

#### Common fixes

The documentation for declarations that are annotated with `@deprecated`
should indicate what code to use in place of the deprecated code.
