The analyzer produces this diagnostic when it encounters an identifier that
appears to be the name of a method but either isn't defined or isn't
visible in the scope in which it's being referenced.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the identifier
`removeMiddle` isn't defined:

```dart
int f(List<int> l) => l.removeMiddle();
```

#### Common fixes

If the identifier isn't defined, then either define it or replace it with
the name of a method that is defined. The example above can be corrected by
fixing the spelling of the method:

```dart
int f(List<int> l) => l.removeLast();
```
