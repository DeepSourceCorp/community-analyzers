title: "Only a generic type, generic function, generic instance method, or generic constructor can have type arguments."
verbose_name: "disallowed_type_instantiation_expression"
category: "bug-risk"
weight: 70
severity: "major"
---
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an expression with a value that
is anything other than one of the allowed kinds of values is followed by
type arguments. The allowed kinds of values are:
- generic types,
- generic constructors, and
- generic functions, including top-level functions, static and instance
  members, and local functions.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `i` is a top-level
variable, which isn't one of the allowed cases:

```dart
int i = 1;

void f() {
  print([!i!]<int>);
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the referenced value is correct, then remove the type arguments:

```dart
int i = 1;

void f() {
  print(i);
}
```
