The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the top-level `name` key has a
value that isn't a string.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the value following the
`name` key is a list:

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
name:
  [!- example!]
```

#### Common fixes

Replace the value with a string:

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
name: example
```
