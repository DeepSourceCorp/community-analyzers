description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the annotation on a field in a
subclass of `Struct` or `Union` doesn't match the Dart type of the field.

For more information about FFI, see [C interop using dart:ffi](https://dart.dev/interop/c-interop).

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the annotation
`Double` doesn't match the Dart type `int`:

```dart
import 'dart:ffi';

final class C extends Struct {
  @Double()
  external int x;
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the type of the field is correct, then change the annotation to match:

```dart
import 'dart:ffi';

final class C extends Struct {
  @Int32()
  external int x;
}
```

If the annotation is correct, then change the type of the field to match:

```dart
import 'dart:ffi';

final class C extends Struct {
  @Double()
  external double x;
}
```
