description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a constant defined in a library
that is imported as a deferred library is referenced in the argument list
of an annotation. Annotations are evaluated at compile time, and values
from deferred libraries aren't available at compile time.

For more information, check out
[Lazily loading a library](https://dart.dev/language/libraries#lazily-loading-a-library).

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the constant `pi` is
being referenced in the argument list of an annotation, even though the
library that defines it is being imported as a deferred library:

```dart
import 'dart:math' deferred as math;

class C {
  const C(double d);
}

@C(math.pi)
void f () {}
```

#### Common fixes

If you need to reference the imported constant, then remove the `deferred`
keyword:

```dart
import 'dart:math' as math;

class C {
  const C(double d);
}

@C(math.pi)
void f () {}
```

If the import is required to be deferred and there's another constant that
is appropriate, then use that constant in place of the constant from the
deferred library.
