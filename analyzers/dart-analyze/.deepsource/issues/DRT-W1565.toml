description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a dependency has a `path` key
whose value is a string, but isn't a POSIX-style path.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the path following the
`path` key is a Windows path:

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
name: example
dependencies:
  local_package:
    path: [!E:\local_package!]
```

#### Common fixes

Convert the path to a POSIX path.
