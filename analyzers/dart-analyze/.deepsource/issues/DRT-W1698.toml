description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a local variable is declared but
never read, even if it's written in one or more places.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the value of `count` is
never read:

```dart
void main() {
  int count = 0;
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the variable isn't needed, then remove it.

If the variable was intended to be used, then add the missing code.
