description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the first expression in an
assert has a type other than `bool`.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the type of `p` is
`int`, but a `bool` is required:

```dart
void f(int p) {
  assert([!p!]);
}
```

#### Common fixes

Change the expression so that it has the type `bool`:

```dart
void f(int p) {
  assert(p > 0);
}
```
