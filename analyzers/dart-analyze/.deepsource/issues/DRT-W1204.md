**DO** use rethrow to rethrow a caught exception.

As Dart provides rethrow as a feature, it should be used to improve terseness
and readability.

**BAD:**
```dart
try {
  somethingRisky();
} catch(e) {
  if (!canHandle(e)) throw e;
  handle(e);
}
```

**GOOD:**
```dart
try {
  somethingRisky();
} catch(e) {
  if (!canHandle(e)) rethrow;
  handle(e);
}
```
