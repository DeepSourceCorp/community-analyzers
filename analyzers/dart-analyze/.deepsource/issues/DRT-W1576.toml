description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an import prefix is used in a
context where it isn't visible because it was shadowed by a local
declaration.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the prefix `a` is
being used to access the class `Future`, but isn't visible because it's
shadowed by the parameter `a`:

```dart
import 'dart:async' as a;

a.Future? f(int a) {
  a.Future? x;
  return x;
}
```

#### Common fixes

Rename either the prefix:

```dart
import 'dart:async' as p;

p.Future? f(int a) {
  p.Future? x;
  return x;
}
```

Or rename the local variable:

```dart
import 'dart:async' as a;

a.Future? f(int p) {
  a.Future? x;
  return x;
}
```
