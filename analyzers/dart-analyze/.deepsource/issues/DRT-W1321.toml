verbose_name = "empty_record_type_with_comma"
description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a record type that has no
fields has a trailing comma. Empty record types can't contain a comma.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the empty record type
has a trailing comma:

```dart
void f((,) r) {}
```

#### Common fixes

If the record type is intended to be empty, then remove the comma:

```dart
void f(() r) {}
```

If the record type is intended to have one or more fields, then add the
types of those fields:

```dart
void f((int, int) r) {}
```
