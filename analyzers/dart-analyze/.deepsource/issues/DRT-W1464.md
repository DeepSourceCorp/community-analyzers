title: "The declaration named 'main' must be a function."

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a library contains a declaration
of the name `main` that isn't the declaration of a top-level function.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the name `main` is
being used to declare a top-level variable:

```dart
var [!main!] = 3;
```

#### Common fixes

Use a different name for the declaration:

```dart
var mainIndex = 3;
```
