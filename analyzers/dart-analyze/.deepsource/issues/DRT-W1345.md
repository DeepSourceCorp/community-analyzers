title: "Extensions can't declare abstract members."

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an abstract declaration is
declared in an extension. Extensions can declare only concrete members.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the method `a` doesn't
have a body:

```dart
extension E on String {
  int [!a!]();
}
```

#### Common fixes

Either provide an implementation for the member or remove it.
