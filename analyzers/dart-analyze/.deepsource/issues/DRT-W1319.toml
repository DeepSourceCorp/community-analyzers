description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a record literal that has no
fields has a trailing comma. Empty record literals can't contain a comma.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the empty record
literal has a trailing comma:

```dart
var r = (,);
```

#### Common fixes

If the record is intended to be empty, then remove the comma:

```dart
var r = ();
```

If the record is intended to have one or more fields, then add the
expressions used to compute the values of those fields:

```dart
var r = (3, 4);
```
