title: "The value of the 'asset' field is expected to be a list of relative file paths"

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the value of the `asset` key
isn't a list.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the value of the assets
key is a string when a list is expected:

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
name: example
flutter:
  assets: [!assets/!]
```

#### Common fixes

Change the value of the asset list so that it's a list:

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
name: example
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/
```
