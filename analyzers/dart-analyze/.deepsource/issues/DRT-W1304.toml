description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a name is declared, and there is
a previous declaration with the same name in the same scope.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the name `x` is
declared twice:

```dart
int x = 0;
int x = 1;
```

#### Common fixes

Choose a different name for one of the declarations.

```dart
int x = 0;
int y = 1;
```
