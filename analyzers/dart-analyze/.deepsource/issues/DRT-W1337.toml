description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a map literal has either one or
more than two type arguments.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the map literal has
three type arguments when it can have either two or zero:

```dart
var m = <int, String, int>{};
```

#### Common fixes

Remove all except two of the type arguments:

```dart
var m = <int, String>{};
```
