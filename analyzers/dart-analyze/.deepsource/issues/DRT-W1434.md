title: "The 'platforms' field must be a map with platforms as keys."
verbose_name: "invalid_platforms_field"
category: "bug-risk"
weight: 70
severity: "major"
---
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a top-level `platforms`
field is specified, but its value is not a map with keys.
To learn more about specifying your package's supported platforms,
check out the [documentation on platform declarations](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec#platforms).

#### Example

The following `pubspec.yaml` produces this diagnostic because `platforms`
should be a map.

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
name: example
platforms:
  [!- android
  - web
  - ios!]
```

#### Common fixes

If you can rely on automatic platform detection, then omit the
top-level `platforms` field. 

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
name: example
```

If you need to manually specify the list of supported platforms, then
write the `platforms` field as a map with platform names as keys.

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
name: example
platforms:
  android:
  web:
  ios:
```
