The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a constructor redirects to a
constructor that doesn't exist.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the factory
constructor in `A` redirects to a constructor in `B` that doesn't exist:

```dart
class A {
  factory A() = [!B.name!];
}

class B implements A {
  B();
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the constructor being redirected to is correct, then define the
constructor:

```dart
class A {
  factory A() = B.name;
}

class B implements A {
  B();
  B.name();
}
```

If a different constructor should be invoked, then update the redirect:

```dart
class A {
  factory A() = B;
}

class B implements A {
  B();
}
```
