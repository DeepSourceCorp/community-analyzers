The analyzer produces this diagnostic when there's an entry under
`dev_dependencies` for a package that is also listed under `dependencies`.
The packages under `dependencies` are available to all of the code in the
package, so there's no need to also list them under `dev_dependencies`.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the package `meta` is
listed under both `dependencies` and `dev_dependencies`:

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
name: example
dependencies:
  meta: ^1.0.2
dev_dependencies:
  [!meta!]: ^1.0.2
```

#### Common fixes

Remove the entry under `dev_dependencies` (and the `dev_dependencies` key
if that's the only package listed there):

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
name: example
dependencies:
  meta: ^1.0.2
```
