The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an instance field is marked as
being const.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `f` is an instance
field:

```dart
class C {
  [!const!] int f = 3;
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the field needs to be an instance field, then remove the keyword
`const`, or replace it with `final`:

```dart
class C {
  final int f = 3;
}
```

If the field really should be a const field, then make it a static field:

```dart
class C {
  static const int f = 3;
}
```
