**DO** annotate redeclared members.

This practice improves code readability and helps protect against
unintentionally redeclaring members or being surprised when a member ceases to
redeclare (due for example to a rename refactoring).

**BAD:**
```dart
class C {
  void f() { }
}

extension type E(C c) implements C {
  void f() {
    ...
  }
}
```

**GOOD:**
```dart
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

class C {
  void f() { }
}

extension type E(C c) implements C {
  @redeclare
  void f() {
    ...
  }
}
```
