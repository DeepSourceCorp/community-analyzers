description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a static method contains an
unqualified reference to an instance member.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the instance field `x`
is being referenced in a static method:

```dart
class C {
  int x;

  static int m() {
    return [!x!];
  }
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the method must reference the instance member, then it can't be static,
so remove the keyword:

```dart
class C {
  int x;

  int m() {
    return x;
  }
}
```

If the method can't be made an instance method, then add a parameter so
that an instance of the class can be passed in:

```dart
class C {
  int x;

  static int m(C c) {
    return c.x;
  }
}
```
