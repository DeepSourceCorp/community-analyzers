description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a constructor declaration is
found in an extension. It isn't valid to define a constructor because
extensions aren't classes, and it isn't possible to create an instance of
an extension.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because there is a constructor
declaration in `E`:

```dart
extension E on String {
  E() : super();
}
```

#### Common fixes

Remove the constructor or replace it with a static method.
