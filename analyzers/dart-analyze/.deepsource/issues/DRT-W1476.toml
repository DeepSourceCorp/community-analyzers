The analyzer produces this diagnostic when there's no top-level `name` key.
The `name` key provides the name of the package, which is required.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the package doesn't
have a name:

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
dependencies:
  meta: ^1.0.2
```

#### Common fixes

Add the top-level key `name` with a value that's the name of the package:

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
name: example
dependencies:
  meta: ^1.0.2
```
