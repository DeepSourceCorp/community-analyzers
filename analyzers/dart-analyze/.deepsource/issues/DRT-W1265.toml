The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the runtime type of a constant
value can't be assigned to the static type of a constant constructor's
parameter.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the runtime type of `i`
is `int`, which can't be assigned to the static type of `s`:

```dart
class C {
  final String s;

  const C(this.s);
}

const dynamic i = 0;

void f() {
  const C([!i!]);
}
```

#### Common fixes

Pass a value of the correct type to the constructor:

```dart
class C {
  final String s;

  const C(this.s);
}

const dynamic i = 0;

void f() {
  const C('$i');
}
```
