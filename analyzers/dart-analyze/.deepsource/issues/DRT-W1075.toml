**AVOID** using await on anything which is not a future.

Await is allowed on the types: `Future<X>`, `FutureOr<X>`, `Future<X>?`, 
`FutureOr<X>?` and `dynamic`.

Further, using `await null` is specifically allowed as a way to introduce a
microtask delay.

**BAD:**
```dart
main() async {
  print(await 23);
}
```
**GOOD:**
```dart
main() async {
  await null; // If a delay is really intended.
  print(23);
}
```
