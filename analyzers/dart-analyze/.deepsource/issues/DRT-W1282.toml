The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a subclass of either `Struct`
or `Union` is instantiated using a generative constructor.

For more information about FFI, see [C interop using dart:ffi][ffi].

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the class `C` is being
instantiated using a generative constructor:

```dart
import 'dart:ffi';

final class C extends Struct {
  @Int32()
  external int a;
}

void f() {
  [!C!]();
}
```

#### Common fixes

If you need to allocate the structure described by the class, then use the
`ffi` package to do so:

```dart
import 'dart:ffi';
import 'package:ffi/ffi.dart';

final class C extends Struct {
  @Int32()
  external int a;
}

void f() {
  final pointer = calloc.allocate<C>(4);
  final c = pointer.ref;
  print(c);
  calloc.free(pointer);
}
```
