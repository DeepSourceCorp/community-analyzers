The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an enum declaration contains a
generative constructor that isn't marked as `const`.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the constructor in `E`
isn't marked as being `const`:

```dart
enum E {
  e;

  [!E!]();
}
```

#### Common fixes

Add the `const` keyword before the constructor:

```dart
enum E {
  e;

  const E();
}
```
