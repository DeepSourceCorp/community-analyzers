description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an enum constant is being
created using either a factory constructor or a generative constructor
that isn't marked as being `const`.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the enum constant `e`
is being initialized by a factory constructor:

```dart
enum E {
  e();

  factory E() => e;
}
```

#### Common fixes

Use a generative constructor marked as `const`:

```dart
enum E {
  e._();

  factory E() => e;

  const E._();
}
```
