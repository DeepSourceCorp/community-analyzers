description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an integer literal has a value
that is too large (positive) or too small (negative) to be represented in a
64-bit word.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the value can't be
represented in 64 bits:

```dart
var x = 9223372036854775810;
```

#### Common fixes

If you need to represent the current value, then wrap it in an instance of
the class `BigInt`:

```dart
var x = BigInt.parse('9223372036854775810');
```
