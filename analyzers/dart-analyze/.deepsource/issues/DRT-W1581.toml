description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a record literal with a single
positional field doesn't have a trailing comma after the field.

In some locations a record literal with a single positional field could
also be a parenthesized expression. A trailing comma is required to
disambiguate these two valid interpretations.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the record literal has
one positional field but doesn't have a trailing comma:

```dart
var r = const (1);
```

#### Common fixes

Add a trailing comma:

```dart
var r = const (1,);
```
