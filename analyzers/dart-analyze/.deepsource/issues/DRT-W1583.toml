description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the value of a compile-time
constant is defined in terms of itself, either directly or indirectly,
creating an infinite loop.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic twice because both of the
constants are defined in terms of the other:

```dart
const [!secondsPerHour!] = minutesPerHour * 60;
const [!minutesPerHour!] = secondsPerHour / 60;
```

#### Common fixes

Break the cycle by finding an alternative way of defining at least one of
the constants:

```dart
const secondsPerHour = minutesPerHour * 60;
const minutesPerHour = 60;
```
