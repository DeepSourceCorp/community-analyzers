Calling `toString` on a runtime type is a non-trivial operation that can
negatively impact performance. It's better to avoid it.

**BAD:**
```dart
class A {
  String toString() => '$runtimeType()';
}
```

**GOOD:**
```dart
class A {
  String toString() => 'A()';
}
```

This lint has some exceptions where performance is not a problem or where real
type information is more important than performance:

* in an assertion
* in a throw expression
* in a catch clause
* in a mixin declaration
* in an abstract class declaration
