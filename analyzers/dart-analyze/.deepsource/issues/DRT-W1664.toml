The analyzer produces this diagnostic when it encounters an identifier that
appears to be the name of a getter but either isn't defined or isn't
visible in the scope in which it's being referenced.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `String` has no member
named `len`:

```dart
int f(String s) => s.len;
```

#### Common fixes

If the identifier isn't defined, then either define it or replace it with
the name of a getter that is defined. The example above can be corrected by
fixing the spelling of the getter:

```dart
int f(String s) => s.length;
```
