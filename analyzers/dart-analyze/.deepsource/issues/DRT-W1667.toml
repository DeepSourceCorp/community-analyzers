severity = "major"

verbose_name = "undefined_identifier_await"
description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name `await` is used in a
method or function body without being declared, and the body isn't marked
with the `async` keyword. The name `await` only introduces an await
expression in an asynchronous function.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the name `await` is
used in the body of `f` even though the body of `f` isn't marked with the
`async` keyword:

```dart
void f(p) { [!await!] p; }
```

#### Common fixes

Add the keyword `async` to the function body:

```dart
void f(p) async { await p; }
```
