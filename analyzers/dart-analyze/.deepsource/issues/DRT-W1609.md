title: "The use of the operator '{0}' for 'bool' operands in a constant context wasn't supported until version 2.3.2, but this code is required to be able to run on earlier versions"

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when any use of the `&`, `|`, or `^`
operators on the class `bool` inside a [constant context][] is found in
code that has an SDK constraint whose lower bound is less than 2.3.2. Using
these operators in a [constant context][] wasn't supported in earlier
versions, so this code won't be able to run against earlier versions of the
SDK.

#### Example

Here's an example of a pubspec that defines an SDK constraint with a lower
bound of less than 2.3.2:

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
environment:
  sdk: '>=2.1.0 <2.4.0'
```

In the package that has that pubspec, code like the following produces this
diagnostic:

```dart
const bool a = true;
const bool b = false;
const bool c = a [!&!] b;
```

#### Common fixes

If you don't need to support older versions of the SDK, then you can
increase the SDK constraint to allow the operators to be used:

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
environment:
 sdk: '>=2.3.2 <2.4.0'
```

If you need to support older versions of the SDK, then either rewrite the
code to not use these operators, or change the code so that the expression
isn't in a [constant context][]:

```dart
const bool a = true;
const bool b = false;
bool c = a & b;
```
