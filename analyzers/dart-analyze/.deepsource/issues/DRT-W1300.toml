description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the class `Function` is used in
either the `extends`, `implements`, or `with` clause of a class or mixin.
Using the class `Function` in this way has no semantic value, so it's
effectively dead code.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `Function` is used as
the superclass of `F`:

```dart
class F extends Function {}
```

#### Common fixes

Remove the class `Function` from whichever clause it's in, and remove the
whole clause if `Function` is the only type in the clause:

```dart
class F {}
```
