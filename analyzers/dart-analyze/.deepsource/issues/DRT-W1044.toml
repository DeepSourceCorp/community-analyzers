**DO** annotate overridden methods and fields.

This practice improves code readability and helps protect against
unintentionally overriding superclass members.

**BAD:**
```dart
class Cat {
  int get lives => 9;
}

class Lucky extends Cat {
  final int lives = 14;
}
```

**GOOD:**
```dart
abstract class Dog {
  String get breed;
  void bark() {}
}

class Husky extends Dog {
  @override
  final String breed = 'Husky';
  @override
  void bark() {}
}
```
