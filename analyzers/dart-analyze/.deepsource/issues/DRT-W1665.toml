description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a hide combinator includes a
name that isn't defined by the library being imported.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `dart:math` doesn't
define the name `String`:

```dart
import 'dart:math' hide String, max;

var x = min(0, 1);
```

#### Common fixes

If a different name should be hidden, then correct the name. Otherwise,
remove the name from the list:

```dart
import 'dart:math' hide max;

var x = min(0, 1);
```
