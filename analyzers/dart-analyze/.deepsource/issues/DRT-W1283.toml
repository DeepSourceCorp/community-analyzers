The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an instance creation using
either `new` or `const` specifies a name that isn't defined as a class.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `f` is a function
rather than a class:

```dart
int f() => 0;

void g() {
  new f();
}
```

#### Common fixes

If a class should be created, then replace the invalid name with the name
of a valid class:

```dart
int f() => 0;

void g() {
  new Object();
}
```

If the name is the name of a function and you want that function to be
invoked, then remove the `new` or `const` keyword:

```dart
int f() => 0;

void g() {
  f();
}
```
