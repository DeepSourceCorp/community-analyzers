The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an unnamed constructor is
invoked on a class that defines named constructors but the class doesn't
have an unnamed constructor.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `A` doesn't define an
unnamed constructor:

```dart
class A {
  A.a();
}

A f() => [!A!]();
```

#### Common fixes

If one of the named constructors does what you need, then use it:

```dart
class A {
  A.a();
}

A f() => A.a();
```

If none of the named constructors does what you need, and you're able to
add an unnamed constructor, then add the constructor:

```dart
class A {
  A();
  A.a();
}

A f() => A();
```
