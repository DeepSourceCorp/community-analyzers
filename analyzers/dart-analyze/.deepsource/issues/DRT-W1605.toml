description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the static type of a returned
expression isn't assignable to the return type that the closure is required
to have.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `f` is defined to be a
function that returns a `String`, but the closure assigned to it returns an
`int`:

```dart
String Function(String) f = (s) => 3;
```

#### Common fixes

If the return type is correct, then replace the returned value with a value
of the correct type, possibly by converting the existing value:

```dart
String Function(String) f = (s) => 3.toString();
```
