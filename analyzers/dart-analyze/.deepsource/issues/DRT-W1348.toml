description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an extension declaration
declares a member with the same name as a member declared in the class
`Object`. Such a member can never be used because the member in `Object` is
always found first.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `toString` is defined
by `Object`:

```dart
extension E on String {
  String [!toString!]() => this;
}
```

#### Common fixes

Remove the member or rename it so that the name doesn't conflict with the
member in `Object`:

```dart
extension E on String {
  String displayString() => this;
}
```
