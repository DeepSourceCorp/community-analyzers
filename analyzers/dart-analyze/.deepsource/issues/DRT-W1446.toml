title = "Invalid use of visible for overriding member"
weight = 70
severity = "major"
category = "bug-risk"
verbose_name = "invalid_use_of_visible_for_overriding_member"
description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an instance member that is
annotated with [`visibleForOverriding`](https://pub.dev/documentation/meta/latest/meta/visibleForOverriding-constant.html) is
referenced outside the library in which it's declared for any reason other
than to override it.

#### Example

Given a file `a.dart` containing the following declaration:

```dart
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

class A {
  @visibleForOverriding
  void a() {}
}
```

The following code produces this diagnostic because the method `a` is being
invoked even though the only reason it's public is to allow it to be
overridden:

```dart
import 'a.dart';

class B extends A {
  void b() {
    a();
  }
}
```

#### Common fixes

Remove the invalid use of the member.
