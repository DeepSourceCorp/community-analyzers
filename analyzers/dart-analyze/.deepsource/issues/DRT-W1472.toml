description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when there's a package that has been
imported in the source but is not listed as a dependency of the
importing package.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the package `path` is
not listed as a dependency, while there is an import statement
with package `path` in the source code of package `example`:

```yaml
name: example
dependencies:
  meta: ^1.0.2
```

#### Common fixes

Add the missing package `path` to the `dependencies` field:

```yaml
name: example
dependencies:
  meta: ^1.0.2
  path: any
```
