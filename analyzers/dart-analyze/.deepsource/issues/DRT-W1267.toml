description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a constructor that is marked as
`const` invokes a constructor from its superclass that isn't marked as
`const`.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the `const` constructor
in `B` invokes the constructor `nonConst` from the class `A`, and the
superclass constructor isn't a `const` constructor:

```dart
class A {
  const A();
  A.nonConst();
}

class B extends A {
  const B() : super.nonConst();
}
```

#### Common fixes

If it isn't essential to invoke the superclass constructor that is
currently being invoked, then invoke a constant constructor from the
superclass:

```dart
class A {
  const A();
  A.nonConst();
}

class B extends A {
  const B() : super();
}
```

If it's essential that the current constructor be invoked and if you can
modify it, then add `const` to the constructor in the superclass:

```dart
class A {
  const A();
  const A.nonConst();
}

class B extends A {
  const B() : super.nonConst();
}
```

If it's essential that the current constructor be invoked and you can't
modify it, then remove `const` from the constructor in the subclass:

```dart
class A {
  const A();
  A.nonConst();
}

class B extends A {
  B() : super.nonConst();
}
```
