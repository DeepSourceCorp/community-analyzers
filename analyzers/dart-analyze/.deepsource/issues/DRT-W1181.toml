From [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/documentation#do-use--doc-comments-to-document-members-and-types):

**DO** use `///` for documentation comments.

Although Dart supports two syntaxes of doc comments (`///` and `/**`), we
prefer using `///` for doc comments.

**GOOD:**
```dart
/// Parses a set of option strings. For each option:
///
/// * If it is `null`, then it is ignored.
/// * If it is a string, then [validate] is called on it.
/// * If it is any other type, it is *not* validated.
void parse(List options) {
  // ...
}
```

Within a doc comment, you can use markdown for formatting.
