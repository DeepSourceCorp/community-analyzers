The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the target of an assignment is a
method.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `f` can't be assigned a
value because it's a method:

```dart
class C {
  void f() {}

  void g() {
    f = null;
  }
}
```

#### Common fixes

Rewrite the code so that there isn't an assignment to a method.
