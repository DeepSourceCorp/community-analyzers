description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a redirecting constructor (a
constructor that redirects to another constructor in the same class) has an
assert in the initializer list.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the unnamed constructor
is a redirecting constructor and also has an assert in the initializer
list:

```dart
class C {
  C(int x) : assert(x > 0), this.name();
  C.name() {}
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the assert isn't needed, then remove it:

```dart
class C {
  C(int x) : this.name();
  C.name() {}
}
```

If the assert is needed, then convert the constructor into a factory
constructor:

```dart
class C {
  factory C(int x) {
    assert(x > 0);
    return C.name();
  }
  C.name() {}
}
```
