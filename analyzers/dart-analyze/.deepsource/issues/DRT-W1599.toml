description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a map pattern contains a rest
pattern. Map patterns match a map with more keys
than those explicitly given in the pattern (as long as the given keys match),
so a rest pattern is unnecessary.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the map pattern contains
a rest pattern:

```dart
void f(Map<int, String> x) {
  if (x case {0: _, ...}) {}
}
```

#### Common fixes

Remove the rest pattern:

```dart
void f(Map<int, String> x) {
  if (x case {0: _}) {}
}
```
