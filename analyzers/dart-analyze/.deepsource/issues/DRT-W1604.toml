description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a method or function returns a
value whose type isn't assignable to the declared return type.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `f` has a return type
of `String` but is returning an `int`:

```dart
String f() => 3;
```

#### Common fixes

If the return type is correct, then replace the value being returned with a
value of the correct type, possibly by converting the existing value:

```dart
String f() => 3.toString();
```

If the value is correct, then change the return type to match:

```dart
int f() => 3;
```
