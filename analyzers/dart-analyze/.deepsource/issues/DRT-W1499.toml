description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an immutable class defines one
or more instance fields that aren't final. A class is immutable if it's
marked as being immutable using the annotation
[`immutable`][meta-immutable] or if it's a subclass of an immutable class.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the field `x` isn't
final:

```dart
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

@immutable
class C {
  int x;

  C(this.x);
}
```

#### Common fixes

If instances of the class should be immutable, then add the keyword `final`
to all non-final field declarations:

```dart
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

@immutable
class C {
  final int x;

  C(this.x);
}
```

If the instances of the class should be mutable, then remove the
annotation, or choose a different superclass if the annotation is
inherited:

```dart
class C {
  int x;

  C(this.x);
}
```
