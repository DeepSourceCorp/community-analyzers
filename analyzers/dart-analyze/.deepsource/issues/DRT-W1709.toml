description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a declaration of an operator has
the wrong number of parameters.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the operator `+` must
have a single parameter corresponding to the right operand:

```dart
class C {
  int operator +(a, b) => 0;
}
```

#### Common fixes

Add or remove parameters to match the required number:

```dart
class C {
  int operator +(a) => 0;
}
```
