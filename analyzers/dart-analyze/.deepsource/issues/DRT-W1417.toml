description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a method that is annotated with
the [`factory`][meta-factory] annotation has a return type of `void`.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the method `createC`
is annotated with the [`factory`][meta-factory] annotation but doesn't
return any value:

```dart
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

class Factory {
  @factory
  void createC() {}
}

class C {}
```

#### Common fixes

Change the return type to something other than `void`:

```dart
import 'package:meta/meta.dart';

class Factory {
  @factory
  C createC() => C();
}

class C {}
```
