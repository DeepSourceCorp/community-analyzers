description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when either the type `dynamic` or the
type `Null` is followed by a question mark. Both of these types are
inherently nullable so the question mark doesn't change the semantics.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the question mark
following `dynamic` isn't necessary:

```dart
dynamic? x;
```

#### Common fixes

Remove the unneeded question mark:

```dart
dynamic x;
```
