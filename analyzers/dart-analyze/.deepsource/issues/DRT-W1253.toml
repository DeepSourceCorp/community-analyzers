description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the name following the `as` in a
cast expression is defined to be something other than a type.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `x` is a variable, not
a type:

```dart
num x = 0;
int y = x as x;
```

#### Common fixes

Replace the name with the name of a type:

```dart
num x = 0;
int y = x as int;
```
