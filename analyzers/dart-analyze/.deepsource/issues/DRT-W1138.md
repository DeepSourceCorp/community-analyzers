**DO** use `forEach` if you are only going to apply a function or a method
to all the elements of an iterable.

Using `forEach` when you are only going to apply a function or method to all
elements of an iterable is a good practice because it makes your code more
terse.

**BAD:**
```dart
for (final key in map.keys.toList()) {
  map.remove(key);
}
```

**GOOD:**
```dart
map.keys.toList().forEach(map.remove);
```

**NOTE:** Replacing a for each statement with a forEach call may change the
behavior in the case where there are side-effects on the iterable itself.
```dart
for (final v in myList) {
  foo().f(v); // This code invokes foo() many times.
}

myList.forEach(foo().f); // But this one invokes foo() just once.
```
