The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a [part file][] is imported
into a library.

#### Example

Given a [part file][] named `part.dart` containing the following:

```dart
part of lib;
```

The following code produces this diagnostic because imported files can't
have a part-of directive:

```dart
library lib;

import [!'part.dart'!];
```

#### Common fixes

Import the library that contains the [part file][] rather than the
[part file][] itself.
