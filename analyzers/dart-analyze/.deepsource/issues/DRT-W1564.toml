The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a dependency has a `path` key
referencing a directory that doesn't exist.

#### Example

Assuming that the directory `doesNotExist` doesn't exist, the following
code produces this diagnostic because it's listed as the path of a package:

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
name: example
dependencies:
  local_package:
    path: [!doesNotExist!]
```

#### Common fixes

If the path is correct, then create a directory at that path.

If the path isn't correct, then change the path to match the path to the
root of the package.
