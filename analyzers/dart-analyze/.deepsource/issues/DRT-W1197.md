Classes that look like enumerations should be declared as `enum`s.

**DO** use enums where appropriate.

Candidates for enums are classes that:

  * are concrete,
  * are private or have only private generative constructors,
  * have two or more static const fields with the same type as the class,
  * have generative constructors that are only invoked at the top-level of the
    initialization expression of these static fields,
  * do not define `hashCode`, `==`, `values` or `index`,
  * do not extend any class other than `Object`, and
  * have no subclasses declared in the defining library.

To learn more about creating and using these enums, check out
[Declaring enhanced enums](https://dart.dev/language/enums#declaring-enhanced-enums).

**BAD:**
```dart
class LogPriority {
  static const error = LogPriority._(1, 'Error');
  static const warning = LogPriority._(2, 'Warning');
  static const log = LogPriority._unknown('Log');

  final String prefix;
  final int priority;
  const LogPriority._(this.priority, this.prefix);
  const LogPriority._unknown(String prefix) : this._(-1, prefix);
}
```

**GOOD:**
```dart
enum LogPriority {
  error(1, 'Error'),
  warning(2, 'Warning'),
  log.unknown('Log');

  final String prefix;
  final int priority;
  const LogPriority(this.priority, this.prefix);
  const LogPriority.unknown(String prefix) : this(-1, prefix);
}
```
