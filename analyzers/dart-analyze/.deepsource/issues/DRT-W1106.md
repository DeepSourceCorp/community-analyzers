**DON'T** use a leading underscore for identifiers that aren't private. Dart
uses a leading underscore in an identifier to mark members and top-level
declarations as private. This trains users to associate a leading underscore
with one of those kinds of declarations. They see `_` and  think "private".
There is no concept of "private" for local variables or parameters.  When one of 
those has a name that starts with an underscore, it sends a confusing signal to
the reader. To avoid that, don't use leading underscores in those names.

**EXCEPTION:**: An unused parameter can be named `_`, `__`, `___`, etc.  This is
common practice in callbacks where you are passed a value but you don't need
to use it. Giving it a name that consists solely of underscores is the idiomatic
way to indicate that the value isn't used.

**BAD:**
```dart
void print(String _name) {
  var _size = _name.length;
  ...
}
```
**GOOD:**

```dart
void print(String name) {
  var size = name.length;
  ...
}
```

**OK:**

```dart
[1,2,3].map((_) => print('Hello'));
```
