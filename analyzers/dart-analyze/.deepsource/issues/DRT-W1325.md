title: "Mixins applied to enums can't have instance variables"
verbose_name: "enum_mixin_with_instance_variable"
category: "bug-risk"
weight: 70
severity: "major"
---
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a mixin that's applied to an
enum declares one or more instance variables. This isn't allowed because
the enum constants are constant, and there isn't any way for the
constructor in the enum to initialize any of the mixin's fields.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the mixin `M` defines
the instance field `x`:

```dart
mixin M {
  int x = 0;
}

enum E with [!M!] {
  a
}
```

#### Common fixes

If you need to apply the mixin, then change all instance fields into
getter and setter pairs and implement them in the enum if necessary:

```dart
mixin M {
  int get x => 0;
}

enum E with M {
  a
}
```

If you don't need to apply the mixin, then remove it:

```dart
enum E {
  a
}
```
