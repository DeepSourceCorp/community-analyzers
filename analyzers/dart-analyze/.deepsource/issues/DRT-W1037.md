From the [Pubspec format description](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec):

**DO** use `lowercase_with_underscores` for package names.

Package names should be all lowercase, with underscores to separate words,
`just_like_this`.  Use only basic Latin letters and Arabic digits: [a-z0-9_].
Also, make sure the name is a valid Dart identifier -- that it doesn't start
with digits and isn't a reserved word.
