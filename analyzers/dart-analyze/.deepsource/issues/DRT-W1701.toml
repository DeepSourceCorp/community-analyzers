The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an import, export, or part
directive is found where the URI refers to a file that doesn't exist.

#### Example

If the file `lib.dart` doesn't exist, the following code produces this
diagnostic:

```dart
import [!'lib.dart'!];
```

#### Common fixes

If the URI was mistyped or invalid, then correct the URI.

If the URI is correct, then create the file.
