title: "The exported library '{0}' can't have a part-of directive."
verbose_name: "export_of_non_library"
category: "bug-risk"
weight: 70
severity: "major"
---
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an export directive references a
part rather than a library.

#### Example

Given a file `part.dart` containing

```dart
part of lib;
```

The following code produces this diagnostic because the file `part.dart` is
a part, and only libraries can be exported:

```dart
library lib;

export [!'part.dart'!];
```

#### Common fixes

Either remove the export directive, or change the URI to be the URI of the
library containing the part.
