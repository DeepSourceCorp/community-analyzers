description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an annotation is the invocation
of an existing constructor even though the invoked constructor isn't a
const constructor.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the constructor for `C`
isn't a const constructor:

```dart
@C()
void f() {
}

class C {
  C();
}
```

#### Common fixes

If it's valid for the class to have a const constructor, then create a
const constructor that can be used for the annotation:

```dart
@C()
void f() {
}

class C {
  const C();
}
```

If it isn't valid for the class to have a const constructor, then either
remove the annotation or use a different class for the annotation.
