description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when an inherited member (method,
getter, setter, or operator) is referenced using `super`, but there's no
member with that name in the superclass chain.

#### Examples

The following code produces this diagnostic because `Object` doesn't define
a method named `n`:

```dart
class C {
  void m() {
    super.n();
  }
}
```

The following code produces this diagnostic because `Object` doesn't define
a getter named `g`:

```dart
class C {
  void m() {
    super.g;
  }
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the inherited member you intend to invoke has a different name, then
make the name of the invoked member match the inherited member.

If the member you intend to invoke is defined in the same class, then
remove the `super.`.

If the member isn't defined, then either add the member to one of the
superclasses or remove the invocation.
