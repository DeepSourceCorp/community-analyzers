title: "Methods can't be assigned a value."
verbose_name: "assignment_to_method"
category: "bug-risk"
weight: 70
severity: "major"
---
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the target of an assignment is a
method.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `f` can't be assigned a
value because it's a method:

```dart
class C {
  void f() {}

  void g() {
    [!f!] = null;
  }
}
```

#### Common fixes

Rewrite the code so that there isn't an assignment to a method.
