title = "Implicit generative constructor in subclass cannot invoke explicit unnamed factory constructor in superclass"

description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a class has an implicit
generative constructor and the superclass has an explicit unnamed factory
constructor. The implicit constructor in the subclass implicitly invokes
the unnamed constructor in the superclass, but generative constructors can
only invoke another generative constructor, not a factory constructor.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the implicit
constructor in `B` invokes the unnamed constructor in `A`, but the
constructor in `A` is a factory constructor, when a generative constructor
is required:

```dart
class A {
  factory A() => throw 0;
  A.named();
}

class B extends A {}
```

#### Common fixes

If the unnamed constructor in the superclass can be a generative
constructor, then change it to be a generative constructor:

```dart
class A {
  A();
  A.named();
}

class B extends A { }
```

If the unnamed constructor can't be a generative constructor and there are
other generative constructors in the superclass, then explicitly invoke
one of them:

```dart
class A {
  factory A() => throw 0;
  A.named();
}

class B extends A {
  B() : super.named();
}
```

If there are no generative constructors that can be used and none can be
added, then implement the superclass rather than extending it:

```dart
class A {
  factory A() => throw 0;
  A.named();
}

class B implements A {}
```
