title = "Invalid declaration of 'values' in a class that implements 'Enum'."
weight = 70
severity = "major"
category = "bug-risk"
verbose_name = "illegal_enum_values"
description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when either a class that implements
`Enum` or a mixin with a superclass constraint of `Enum` has an instance
member named `values`.

#### Examples

The following code produces this diagnostic because the class `C`, which
implements `Enum`, declares an instance field named `values`:

```dart
abstract class C implements Enum {
  int get values => 0;
}
```

The following code produces this diagnostic because the class `B`, which
implements `Enum`, inherits an instance method named `values` from `A`:

```dart
abstract class A {
  int values() => 0;
}

abstract class B extends A implements Enum {}
```

#### Common fixes

Change the name of the conflicting member:

```dart
abstract class C implements Enum {
  int get value => 0;
}
```
