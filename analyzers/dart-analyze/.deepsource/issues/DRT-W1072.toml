**DON'T** check for null in custom == operators.

As null is a special value, no instance of any class (other than `Null`) can be
equivalent to it.  Thus, it is redundant to check whether the other instance is
null.

**BAD:**
```dart
class Person {
  final String? name;

  @override
  operator ==(Object? other) =>
      other != null && other is Person && name == other.name;
}
```

**GOOD:**
```dart
class Person {
  final String? name;

  @override
  operator ==(Object? other) => other is Person && name == other.name;
}
```
