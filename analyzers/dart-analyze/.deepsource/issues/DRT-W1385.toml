description = '''
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a single class is specified more
than once in an `implements` clause.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `A` is in the list
twice:

```dart
class A {}
class B implements A, A {}
```

#### Common fixes

Remove all except one occurrence of the class name:

```dart
class A {}
class B implements A {}
```
