The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a superclass constructor is
invoked in the initializer list of a constructor, but the superclass
doesn't define the constructor being invoked.

#### Examples

The following code produces this diagnostic because `A` doesn't have an
unnamed constructor:

```dart
class A {
  A.n();
}
class B extends A {
  B() : [!super()!];
}
```

The following code produces this diagnostic because `A` doesn't have a
constructor named `m`:

```dart
class A {
  A.n();
}
class B extends A {
  B() : [!super.m()!];
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the superclass defines a constructor that should be invoked, then change
the constructor being invoked:

```dart
class A {
  A.n();
}
class B extends A {
  B() : super.n();
}
```

If the superclass doesn't define an appropriate constructor, then define
the constructor being invoked:

```dart
class A {
  A.m();
  A.n();
}
class B extends A {
  B() : super.m();
}
```
