description = """
**DO** await functions that return a `Future` inside of an async function body.

It's easy to forget await in async methods as naming conventions usually don't
tell us if a method is sync or async (except for some in `dart:io`).

When you really _do_ want to start a fire-and-forget `Future`, the recommended
way is to use `unawaited` from `dart:async`. The `// ignore` and
`// ignore_for_file` comments also work.

**BAD:**
```dart
void main() async {
  doSomething(); // Likely a bug.
}
```

**GOOD:**
```dart
Future doSomething() => ...;

void main() async {
  await doSomething();

  unawaited(doSomething()); // Explicitly-ignored fire-and-forget.
}
```
