The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the expression following `in` in
a for-in loop has a type that isn't a subclass of `Iterable`.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `m` is a `Map`, and
`Map` isn't a subclass of `Iterable`:

```dart
void f(Map<String, String> m) {
  for (String s in [!m!]) {
    print(s);
  }
}
```

#### Common fixes

Replace the expression with one that produces an iterable value:

```dart
void f(Map<String, String> m) {
  for (String s in m.values) {
    print(s);
  }
}
```
