The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a package under either
`dependencies` or `dev_dependencies` isn't a pub, `git`, or `path` based
dependency.

See [Package dependencies](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/dependencies) for
more information about the kind of dependencies that are supported.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the dependency on the
package `transmogrify` isn't a pub, `git`, or `path` based dependency:

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
name: example
dependencies:
  transmogrify:
    hosted:
      name: transmogrify
      url: http://your-package-server.com
    version: ^1.4.0
```

#### Common fixes

If you want to publish your package to `pub.dev`, then change the
dependencies to ones that are supported by `pub`.

If you don't want to publish your package to `pub.dev`, then add a
`publish_to: none` entry to mark the package as one that isn't intended to
be published:

{% prettify yaml tag=pre+code %}
name: example
publish_to: none
dependencies:
  transmogrify:
    hosted:
      name: transmogrify
      url: http://your-package-server.com
    version: ^1.4.0
```
