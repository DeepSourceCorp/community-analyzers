description = """
The analyzer produces this diagnostic when there's a circularity in the
type hierarchy. This happens when a type, either directly or indirectly,
is declared to be a subtype of itself.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because the class `A` is
declared to be a subtype of `B`, and `B` is a subtype of `A`:

```dart
class [!A!] extends B {}
class B implements A {}
```

#### Common fixes

Change the type hierarchy so that there's no circularity.
