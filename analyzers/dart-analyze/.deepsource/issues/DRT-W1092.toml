**DO** name source files using `lowercase_with_underscores`.

Some file systems are not case-sensitive, so many projects require filenames to
be all lowercase. Using a separating character allows names to still be readable
in that form. Using underscores as the separator ensures that the name is still
a valid Dart identifier, which may be helpful if the language later supports
symbolic imports.

**BAD:**

* `SliderMenu.dart`
* `filesystem.dart`
* `file-system.dart`

**GOOD:**

* `slider_menu.dart`
* `file_system.dart`

Files without a strict `.dart` extension are ignored.  For example:

**OK:**

* `file-system.g.dart`
* `SliderMenu.css.dart`

The lint `library_names` can be used to enforce the same kind of naming on the
library.
