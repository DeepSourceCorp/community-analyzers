The analyzer produces this diagnostic when the constructor invoked to
initialize an enum constant doesn't exist.

#### Examples

The following code produces this diagnostic because the enum constant `c`
is being initialized by the unnamed constructor, but there's no unnamed
constructor defined in `E`:

```dart
enum E {
  [!c!]();

  const E.x();
}
```

The following code produces this diagnostic because the enum constant `c`
is being initialized by the constructor named `x`, but there's no
constructor named `x` defined in `E`:

```dart
enum E {
  c.[!x!]();

  const E.y();
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the enum constant is being initialized by the unnamed constructor and
one of the named constructors should have been used, then add the name of
the constructor:

```dart
enum E {
  c.x();

  const E.x();
}
```

If the enum constant is being initialized by the unnamed constructor and
none of the named constructors are appropriate, then define the unnamed
constructor:

```dart
enum E {
  c();

  const E();
}
```

If the enum constant is being initialized by a named constructor and one
of the existing constructors should have been used, then change the name
of the constructor being invoked (or remove it if the unnamed constructor
should be used):

```dart
enum E {
  c.y();

  const E();
  const E.y();
}
```

If the enum constant is being initialized by a named constructor and none
of the existing constructors should have been used, then define a
constructor with the name that was used:

```dart
enum E {
  c.x();

  const E.x();
}
```
