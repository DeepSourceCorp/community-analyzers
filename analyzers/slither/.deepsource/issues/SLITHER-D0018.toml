Unprotected call to a function sending Ether to an arbitrary address.

<!--more-->

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract ArbitrarySendEth{
    address destination;
    function setDestination(){
        destination = msg.sender;
    }

    function withdraw() public{
        destination.transfer(this.balance);
    }
}
```
Bob calls `setDestination` and `withdraw`. As a result he withdraws the contract's balance.

## Recommendation
Ensure that an arbitrary user cannot withdraw unauthorized funds.
