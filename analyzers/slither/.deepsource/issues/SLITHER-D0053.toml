Detection of shadowing built-in symbols using local variables, state variables, functions, modifiers, or events.

<!--more-->

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Bug {
    uint now; // Overshadows current time stamp.

    function assert(bool condition) public {
        // Overshadows built-in symbol for providing assertions.
    }

    function get_next_expiration(uint earlier_time) private returns (uint) {
        return now + 259200; // References overshadowed timestamp.
    }
}
```
`now` is defined as a state variable, and shadows with the built-in symbol `now`. The function `assert` overshadows the built-in `assert` function. Any use of either of these built-in symbols may lead to unexpected results.

## Recommendation
Rename the local variables, state variables, functions, modifiers, and events that shadow a builtin symbol.
