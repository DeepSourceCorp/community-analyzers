description = """
A deletion in a structure containing a mapping will not delete the mapping (see the [Solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html##delete)). The remaining data may be used to compromise the contract.

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
    struct BalancesStruct{
        address owner;
        mapping(address => uint) balances;
    }
    mapping(address => BalancesStruct) public stackBalance;

    function remove() internal{
         delete stackBalance[msg.sender];
    }
```
`remove` deletes an item of `stackBalance`.
The mapping `balances` is never deleted, so `remove` does not work as intended.

## Recommendation
Use a lock mechanism instead of a deletion to disable structure containing a mapping.
