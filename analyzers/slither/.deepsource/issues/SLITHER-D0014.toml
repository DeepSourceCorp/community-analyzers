An uninitialized storage variable will act as a reference to the first state variable, and can override a critical variable.

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract Uninitialized{
    address owner = msg.sender;

    struct St{
        uint a;
    }

    function func() {
        St st;
        st.a = 0x0;
    }
}
```
Bob calls `func`. As a result, `owner` is overridden to `0`.


## Recommendation
Initialize all storage variables.
