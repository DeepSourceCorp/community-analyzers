If a codebase has two contracts the similar names, the compilation artifacts
will not contain one of the contracts with the duplicate name.

<!--more-->

## Exploit Scenario

Bob's `truffle` codebase has two contracts named `ERC20`.
When `truffle compile` runs, only one of the two contracts will generate artifacts in `build/contracts`.
As a result, the second contract cannot be analyzed.


## Recommendation
Rename the contract.
