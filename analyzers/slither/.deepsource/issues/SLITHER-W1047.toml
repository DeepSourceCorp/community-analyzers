`tx.origin`-based protection can be abused by a malicious contract if a legitimate user interacts with the malicious contract.

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract TxOrigin {
    address owner = msg.sender;

    function bug() {
        require(tx.origin == owner);
    }
```
Bob is the owner of `TxOrigin`. Bob calls Eve's contract. Eve's contract calls `TxOrigin` and bypasses the `tx.origin` protection.

## Recommendation
Do not use `tx.origin` for authorization.
