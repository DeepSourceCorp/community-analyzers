Detection of the [reentrancy bug](https://github.com/trailofbits/not-so-smart-contracts/tree/master/reentrancy).
Only report reentrancy that acts as a double call (see `reentrancy-eth`, `reentrancy-no-eth`).

<!--more-->

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
function callme(){
    if( ! (msg.sender.call()() ) ){
        throw;
    }
    counter += 1
}   
```

`callme` contains a reentrancy. The reentrancy is benign because it's exploitation would have the same effect as two consecutive calls.

## Recommendation
Apply the [`check-effects-interactions` pattern](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/security-considerations.html#re-entrancy).
