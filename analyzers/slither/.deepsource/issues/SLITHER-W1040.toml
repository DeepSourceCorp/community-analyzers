Detects variables that are written but never read and written again.

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract Buggy{
    function my_func() external initializer{
        // ...
        a = b;
        a = c;
        // ..
    }
}
```
`a` is first asigned to `b`, and then to `c`. As a result the first write does nothing.

## Recommendation
Fix or remove the writes.
