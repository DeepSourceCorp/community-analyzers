Detects logic contract that can be destructed.

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract Buggy is Initializable{
    address payable owner;

    function initialize() external initializer{
        require(owner == address(0));
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    function kill() external{
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        selfdestruct(owner);
    }
}
```
Buggy is an upgradeable contract. Anyone can call initialize on the logic contract, and destruct the contract.


## Recommendation
Add a constructor to ensure `initialize` cannot be called on the logic contract.
