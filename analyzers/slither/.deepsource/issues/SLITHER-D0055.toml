solc versions `0.4.5`-`0.4.26` and `0.5.0`-`0.5.8` contain a compiler bug leading to unexpected behavior when calling uninitialized function pointers in constructors.

<!--more-->

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract bad0 {

  constructor() public {
    /* Uninitialized function pointer */
    function(uint256) internal returns(uint256) a;
    a(10);
  }

}
```
The call to `a(10)` will lead to unexpected behavior because function pointer `a` is not initialized in the constructor.

## Recommendation
Initialize function pointers before calling. Avoid function pointers if possible.
