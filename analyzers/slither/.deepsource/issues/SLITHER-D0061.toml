Unary expressions such as `x=+1` probably typos.

<!--more-->

## Exploit Scenario

```Solidity 
contract Bug{
    uint public counter;

    function increase() public returns(uint){
        counter=+1;
        return counter;
    }
}
```
`increase()` uses `=+` instead of `+=`, so `counter` will never exceed 1.

## Recommendation
Remove the unary expression.
