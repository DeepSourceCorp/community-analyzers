The contract reads its own variable using `this`, adding overhead of an unnecessary STATICCALL.

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract C {
    mapping(uint => address) public myMap;
    function test(uint x) external returns(address) {
        return this.myMap(x);
    }
}
```


## Recommendation
Read the variable directly from storage instead of calling the contract.
