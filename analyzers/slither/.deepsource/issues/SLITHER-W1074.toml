description = """
In Solidity, it is possible to use libraries for certain types, by the `using-for` statement (`using <library> for <type>`). However, the Solidity compiler doesn't check whether a given library has at least one function matching a given type. If it doesn't, such a statement has no effect and may be confusing. 

<!--more-->

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
library L {
    function f(bool) public pure {}
}

using L for uint;
```
Such a code will compile despite the fact that `L` has no function with `uint` as its first argument.

## Recommendation
Make sure that the libraries used in `using-for` statements have at least one function matching a type used in these statements.
