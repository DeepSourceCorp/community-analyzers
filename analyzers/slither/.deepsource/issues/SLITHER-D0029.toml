Weak PRNG due to a modulo on `block.timestamp`, `now` or `blockhash`. These can be influenced by miners to some extent so they should be avoided.

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract Game {

    uint reward_determining_number;

    function guessing() external{
      reward_determining_number = uint256(block.blockhash(10000)) % 10;
    }
}
```
Eve is a miner. Eve calls `guessing` and re-orders the block containing the transaction. 
As a result, Eve wins the game.

## Recommendation
Do not use `block.timestamp`, `now` or `blockhash` as a source of randomness
