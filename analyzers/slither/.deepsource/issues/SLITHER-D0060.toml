Detect missing events for critical arithmetic parameters.

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract C {

    modifier onlyOwner {
        if (msg.sender != owner) throw;
        _;
    }

    function setBuyPrice(uint256 newBuyPrice) onlyOwner public {
        buyPrice = newBuyPrice;
    }

    function buy() external {
     ... // buyPrice is used to determine the number of tokens purchased
    }    
}
```
`setBuyPrice()` does not emit an event, so it is difficult to track changes in the value of `buyPrice` off-chain. 


## Recommendation
Emit an event for critical parameter changes.
