Detect the call to a constructor that is not implemented

<!--more-->

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract A{}
contract B is A{
    constructor() public A(){}
}
```
When reading `B`'s constructor definition, we might assume that `A()` initiates the contract, but no code is executed.

## Recommendation
Remove the constructor call.
