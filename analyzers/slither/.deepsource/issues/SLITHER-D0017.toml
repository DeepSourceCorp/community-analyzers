Detect when `msg.sender` is not used as `from` in transferFrom and permit is used.

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
    function bad(address from, uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s, address to) public {
        erc20.permit(from, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s);
        erc20.transferFrom(from, to, value);
    }
```
If an ERC20 token does not implement permit and has a fallback function e.g. WETH, transferFrom allows an attacker to transfer all tokens approved for this contract.

## Recommendation

Ensure that the underlying ERC20 token correctly implements a permit function.
