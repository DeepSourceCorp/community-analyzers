description = """
Incorrect return values for `ERC20` functions. A contract compiled with Solidity > 0.4.22 interacting with these functions will fail to execute them, as the return value is missing.

<!--more-->

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract Token{
    function transfer(address to, uint value) external;
    //...
}
```
`Token.transfer` does not return a boolean. Bob deploys the token. Alice creates a contract that interacts with it but assumes a correct `ERC20` interface implementation. Alice's contract is unable to interact with Bob's contract.

## Recommendation
Set the appropriate return values and types for the defined `ERC20` functions.
