Detect unprotected variable that are marked protected

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract Buggy{

    /// @custom:security write-protection="onlyOwner()"
    address owner;

    function set_protected() public onlyOwner(){
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function set_not_protected() public{
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}    
```
`owner` must be always written by function using `onlyOwner` (`write-protection="onlyOwner()"`), however anyone can call `set_not_protected`.


## Recommendation
Add access controls to the vulnerable function
