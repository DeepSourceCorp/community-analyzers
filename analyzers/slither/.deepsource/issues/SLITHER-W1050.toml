Uninitialized local variables.

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract Uninitialized is Owner{
    function withdraw() payable public onlyOwner{
        address to;
        to.transfer(this.balance)
    }
}
```
Bob calls `transfer`. As a result, all Ether is sent to the address `0x0` and is lost.

## Recommendation
Initialize all the variables. If a variable is meant to be initialized to zero, explicitly set it to zero to improve code readability.
