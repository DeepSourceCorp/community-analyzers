Detects whether events defined by the `ERC20` specification that should have some parameters as `indexed` are missing the `indexed` keyword.

<!--more-->

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract ERC20Bad {
    // ...
    event Transfer(address from, address to, uint value);
    event Approval(address owner, address spender, uint value);

    // ...
}
```
`Transfer` and `Approval` events should have the 'indexed' keyword on their two first parameters, as defined by the `ERC20` specification.
Failure to include these keywords will exclude the parameter data in the transaction/block's bloom filter, so external tooling searching for these parameters may overlook them and fail to index logs from this token contract.

## Recommendation
Add the `indexed` keyword to event parameters that should include it, according to the `ERC20` specification.
