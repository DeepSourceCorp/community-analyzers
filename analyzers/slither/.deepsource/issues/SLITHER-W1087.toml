Literals with many digits are difficult to read and review.

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract MyContract{
    uint 1_ether = 10000000000000000000; 
}
```

While `1_ether` looks like `1 ether`, it is `10 ether`. As a result, it's likely to be used incorrectly.


## Recommendation

Use:
- [Ether suffix](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#ether-units),
- [Time suffix](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#time-units), or
- [The scientific notation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#rational-and-integer-literals)
