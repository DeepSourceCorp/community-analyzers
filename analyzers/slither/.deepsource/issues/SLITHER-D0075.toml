The use of low-level calls is error-prone. Low-level calls do not check for [code existence](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions) or call success.

## Exploit Scenario


## Recommendation
Avoid low-level calls. Check the call success. If the call is meant for a contract, check for code existence.
