`Delegatecall` or `callcode` to an address controlled by the user.

<!--more-->

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract Delegatecall{
    function delegate(address to, bytes data){
        to.delegatecall(data);
    }
}
```
Bob calls `delegate` and delegates the execution to his malicious contract. As a result, Bob withdraws the funds of the contract and destructs it.

## Recommendation
Avoid using `delegatecall`. Use only trusted destinations.
