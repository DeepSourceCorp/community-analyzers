Detect missing zero address validation.

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract C {

  modifier onlyAdmin {
    if (msg.sender != owner) throw;
    _;
  }

  function updateOwner(address newOwner) onlyAdmin external {
    owner = newOwner;
  }
}
```
Bob calls `updateOwner` without specifying the `newOwner`, so Bob loses ownership of the contract.


## Recommendation
Check that the address is not zero.
