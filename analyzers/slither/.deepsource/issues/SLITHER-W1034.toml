Use of strict equalities that can be easily manipulated by an attacker.

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract Crowdsale{
    function fund_reached() public returns(bool){
        return this.balance == 100 ether;
    }
```
`Crowdsale` relies on `fund_reached` to know when to stop the sale of tokens.
`Crowdsale` reaches 100 Ether. Bob sends 0.1 Ether. As a result, `fund_reached` is always false and the `crowdsale` never ends.

## Recommendation
Don't use strict equality to determine if an account has enough Ether or tokens.
