Uninitialized state variables.

## Exploit Scenario

```solidity
contract Uninitialized{
    address destination;

    function transfer() payable public{
        destination.transfer(msg.value);
    }
}
```
Bob calls `transfer`. As a result, the Ether are sent to the address `0x0` and are lost.


## Recommendation

Initialize all the variables. If a variable is meant to be initialized to zero, explicitly set it to zero to improve code readability.
