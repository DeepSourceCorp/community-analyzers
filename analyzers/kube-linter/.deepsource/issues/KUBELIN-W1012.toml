Alert on deployments with docker.sock mounted in containers.

<!--more-->

## Remediation
Ensure the Docker socket is not mounted inside any containers by removing the associated  Volume and VolumeMount in deployment yaml specification. If the Docker socket is mounted inside a container it could allow processes running within  the container to execute Docker commands which would effectively allow for full control of the host.
