description = """
Indicates when deployments with multiple replicas fail to specify inter-pod anti-affinity, to ensure that the orchestrator attempts to schedule replicas on different nodes.

<!--more-->

## Remediation
Specify anti-affinity in your pod specification to ensure that the orchestrator attempts to schedule replicas on different nodes. Using podAntiAffinity, specify a labelSelector that matches pods for the deployment, and set the topologyKey to kubernetes.io/hostname. Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity for details.
